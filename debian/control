Description: simple scripts for controlling tor and privoxy.
  torcontroller is a Debian package which combines tor, privoxy, systemctl packages, and so on. torcontroller Dev built some scripts to let you just command on Linux: Debian bullseye environments including docker container. You will be able to run your application and control tor router by a function that writes any back-end program.
